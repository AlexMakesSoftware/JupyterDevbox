# README.md

This is a Jupyter notebook environment for Python, installable using devbox shell.

This was part of an exploration into Nix and Devbox as a posible tool for the use of creating idempotent, disposable development environments. I picked a reasonably complicated setup - python3, lots of ML packages and vscodium, with plugins.

To use this, first you need to follow the installation instructions for devbox, available here: https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/

NOTE: This is a WIP, concept evaluator and by no means is it ready for production. I am very new to Nix and Devbox and no doubt this doesn't implement best-practices.

TIP: Make sure you clear all the outputs on your notebook before doing any git opperations - or else you'll keep checking in your notebook.

Development notes:

Codium doesn't always seem to automatically detect the kernel in good time, give it a moment.
